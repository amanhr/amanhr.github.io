Hello. I am a high-school student, and an aspiring mathematician/physicist (still slightly confused). Besides math and physics,
I am also interested in Military History, Music, and Linux (although I have not owned a computer for about 3 years). In mathematics, I am currently interested in Analysis and Topology, 
and in Physics I am currently enjoying learning  Classical Mechanics.
