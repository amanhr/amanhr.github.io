Hello. I am a high-school student, and an aspiring mathematician/physicist (still slightly confused). Besides math and physics,
I am also interested in Military History, Music, and Linux (although I currently do not own a computer :(  ). In mathematics, I am currently interested in Analysis and Topology, 
and in Physics I am currently enjoying learning  Classical Mechanics.
